            <p>ANAAAA loook it’s midnight!!! HAPPY VALENTINE’S DAY I literally can’t let this day pass through without saying how much you mean to me. I have been thinking about this for days, trying to find the right words to express what's in my heart</p>
            <p>First of all, I just want you to know you’re my love. Ever since I've been around you, you just made my world brighter, whether we’re goofing around, having deep conversations, or just chilling in comfortable silence, every moment with you is special and means so much to me</p>
            <p>You know, sometimes I catch myself thinking about all the little things that make you so incredible. The way you make me feel loved and appreciated or how you never fail to see good in others especially in me. It’s literally inspiring you have taught me so much about kindness and empathy and I’m a better person because of you.</p>
            <p>What I am trying to say is. I’m crazy about you. I cant stop thinking about you and its kinda crazy. You have become so much, an important part of my life and I can’t live without you. You are my partner in crime, this is for us baby.</p>
            <p>Here’s also for all the adventures we have had and all the ones still to come. Here’s to the late night talks and countless memories we are making together every single day. </p>
            <p>Thanks for being the most amazing person I know, I love you more then words can say. with all my heart, yours truly kai.</p>
